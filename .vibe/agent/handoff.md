# Handoff

## Current State

The project is a Tauri + React + Node daemon desktop widget. The native widget launches, Vite serves renderer assets during dev, and the daemon listens on `127.0.0.1:4128`.

## Recent Work

- Migrated from Electron to Tauri.
- Verified Windows MSVC/Rust/WebView2 prerequisites.
- Added generated mascot icon resources for Tauri.
- Installed vibe-doctor v1.7.2 project context, provider memory, and harness files so future work can run through sprints.
- Configured Codex provider for Windows via `.\.vibe\harness\scripts\run-codex.cmd`.

## Next Recommended Sprint

`sprint-01-auth-architecture`: define and implement the OAuth-ready auth boundary so the product no longer appears API-key-first, while preserving local mock streaming and daemon development.

## Open Issues

- OAuth/backend proxy not implemented.
- Browser DOM provider is a stub.
- Screen capture/vision provider is a stub.
- Terminal PTY provider is a stub.

## Verification

Completed after harness install:

- `npm run vibe:doctor`
- `node .vibe\harness\scripts\vibe-preflight.mjs --bootstrap`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build:web`
- `npm run smoke`
- `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ". .\scripts\use-msvc-env.ps1; Push-Location src-tauri; cargo check --no-default-features; Pop-Location"`
